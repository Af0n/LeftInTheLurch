# LeftInTheLurch
You are a prisoner in a maximum security tower structure used as your one chance to return to society. Whatever crimes you have committed, you are given a chance to prove your worth by escaping the tower. Your exploits are streamed live for the world to see, and influential people outside can provide you with help.

As a roguelite, power ups are a necessary part of the game. These are called assets. Assets are provided by these rich and powerful people— Associates— and choosing their assets will grow your affiliation with them. Who you affiliate yourself with greatly affects the types of enemies you face. Once your affiliation with a certain associate gets high enough, you can become a consort of an associate. Becoming a consort provides huge, unique buffs. Certain associates will no longer provide you assets if you become a consort of an enemy associate, and it might also induce enraged enemies from an enemy associate if your affiliation with them is low enough. That being said, not all associates are enemies of each other. Some associates have allies which may provide other buffs and/or companions to aid you. Some associates will immediately drop all affiliation with you if you don’t consort yourself under them.
